## en: What is this?

This is a repository for machine learning playground and sample codes.
I want to organize samples for myself because sample codes for machine learning are often of low quality.

- GitHub Actions runs tests for each versions of Python. (Currently 3.10 - 3.12)
  - This range is determined by lifecycle of Python versions and libraries.
  - Python support table: https://devguide.python.org/versions/
  - numpy support table: https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html 
- [Renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate) continuously updates dependencies.
- [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/kitsuyui/ml-playground) measures test coverage.
- [nbmake](https://github.com/treebeardtech/nbmake) tests Jupyter ipynb files.

By doing so, I will ensure that sample codes always function as samples.
